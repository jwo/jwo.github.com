###### Your proven path to develop into a High End Software Consultant.


"How can I get my clients to respect me?"  
"How can I make more money as a freelancer?"  
"How can I become a badass consultant like you?"  

Freelancing was supposed to be fun.  You can have freedom, money, respect. You can run the show, and say no.  Consultants fix problems. Freelancers are hired. You should be a consultant.

###### AngularJS for the Rails Developer

You’ve seen the online AngularJS examples that get you far enough to type in a
box and see it on the screen, but it’s not enough to build something REAL. The
blog posts, js-fiddles, and walkthroughs don’t get you connected to Rails, they
don’t help with data validation, and they don’t help at all trying to get
Angular working with the Asset Pipeline. You’re left wondering where to start,
and doubting if you should use Rails at all.
