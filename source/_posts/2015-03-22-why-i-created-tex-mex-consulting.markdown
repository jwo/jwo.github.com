Employees don't make enough money. You're not treated fairly, are not respected,
and have to put up with a lot of crap. 

Most software developers can learn a hellaton from freelancing and consulting;
at the very least you can learn what you're worth. And it's not $75,000 a year
with free soda and 1% equity.

I've spent 6 years and many thousands of dollars in mistakes, masterclasses,
and good old sweat equity in created a workflow system for expert software
consulting.

I want to give you a path to consulting; a path to go from Employee to
Freelancer to Consultant. A path to freedom, more money, and more respect.

The basic ethos of the book:

> Freelancers are hired by companies. Consultants choose their clients
> carefully.

Want to try out some the techniques in my system? I've created a 30 day free
email course on Professional Freelancing -- try it out below.
