I built Ruby off Rails because ruby is awesome, and there are too many developers who don't realize it. And the more I trained people, the more I found that: _Developers who learn ruby first learn Rails Best_.
###Announcing: [Ruby Off Rails](http://rubyoffrails.com)

That means, they pick up on concepts about instance variables, validations, how to create non-ActiveRecord classes, and most importantly: testing.

So I floated an idea, should we learn Ruby before we learn Rails? The answer from nearly everyone I spoke to was YES.

Enter: [Ruby Off Rails](http://rubyoffrails.com) -- a collaborative learning environment where we master Ruby through Applied Learning. What does that mean?

* It means there's not going to be a class on "Arrays" followed by one on "Syntax". -- We'll build stuff together and learn by doing. 
* It means that each class much have actionable code that someone could actually use in their life
* It means that you can watch the class live, or watch later. Much later.
* It means that students talk to each other, learn from each other, and see each other's code through pull-requests on assignments

And most importantly, it means that we all code.

It's a six week course designed for people who have programmed before. If you haven't developed software, it'll be ambitious, but watch the episodes a couple of times and you'll get the hang of it. And you'll learn TDD first! (you won't be able to imagine a different way).

My true hope is this brings more people into the software development community and fosters coders teaching coders in a constructive and generally nice way.

1. Watch someone code
2. Code
3. Teach someone how to code
