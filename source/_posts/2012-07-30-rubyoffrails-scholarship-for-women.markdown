I have an opportunity to do something, and I want to do it. Ruby is awesome, and I've been inspired by [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com/) and [Kids Code Camp](http://kidscodecamp.com/). I want to bridge the gender gap in software development, and this is an initial step for me to do something.

I am offering a 100% scholarship to the 6 week RubyOffRails class for up to 5 women software developers. <a href="http://comal.wufoo.com/forms/z7x3p9/">Apply Here</a>

The [Ruby online training course](http://rubyoffrails.com) starts July 31, and I'll keep applications open through <del>August 3rd</del> Thursday Morning, August 2nd. It's a self-paced course, so if you start this week you won't be behind. I'll be granting scholarships to the candidates I feel have the best chance to succeed and will have the most impact. Obviously subjective, but I think this will work. Apply and learn how to be a happy programmer!

UPDATE:  
I was asked what my relationship is to RubyOffRails: I created RubyOffRails in April 2012 and run the course: the video codecasts, discussions, and code reviews are all me.
