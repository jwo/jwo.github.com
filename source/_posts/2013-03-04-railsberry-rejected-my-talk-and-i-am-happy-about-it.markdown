I received the greatest email this weekend: RailsBerry had rejected my talk for
their 2013 conference. Normally: another "oh well, they must have found really
great talks to reject mine" and a sigh. Why did I like this rejection email?

### RailsBerry gave me personalized, actionable feedback on making my future submissions better.

<!-- more -->

First, the details about my talk. I've been teaching [Ruby off Rails](http://rubyoffrails)
for a year now. I heart Ruby like a hundred &lt;3s
and think we can show off Ruby more than just showing Rails APIs to developers.

My description of _Teaching Ruby without Rails_

> What are the essential elements of Ruby that an artisan developer ninja
> developer needs to understand before they can see the beauty of Ruby? After all:
> there was Ruby before there was Rails; There is Ruby outside of Rails.
>
> Let's cover examples of how to teach Blocks, Send, Class Eval, and Modules to
> developers who can develop, but not in Ruby land (yet). And, how these 4
> features of Ruby can enlighten Rails and DSLs.

In the 'Why should we choose you' section, I added:

> Honestly? I don't know if you should... I'm a pretty good speaker and people
> have been way supportive of my teaching Ruby without the Rails.
>
> How about why you SHOULDN'T choose me, eh?
>
> - I'm a white male from the US.
> - I'm not an A-list Ruby developer
> - I probably won't get someone to buy tickets that wouldn't buy it already
>
> However, some things that MAY tip the scales in my favor:
>
> - I don't use like a billionty meme's in my talks
> - I'm decently funny and hopefully inspiring
> - I like <3 tacos, Ruby, and Whiskey.

I also included a link to my [Rails Ignite 2012 talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Ucma74yqH6w).
I submitted and waited. In late January, I received an email letting me know I
wasn't selected. It was your standard rejection letter.

OK, I thought -- and didn't buy my plane ticket.  I was pretty surprised when
I received the explanation letter on March 3rd. Here
it is:

### The Letter from Michael @ RailsBerry

> First of all thank you for taking your time and submitting proposal.
> We have received more than 90 and had to select only 7 of them.
> It wasn't an easy task and I'd like to give you a little feedback
> on why we didn't choose ones that you had submitted.
>
> You've submitted :
>   - Teaching Ruby without Rails
>
>   Hmm tough call. You've convinced us that you are a good speaker.
>   However the talk proposal lacked the "wow" factor and might not fit into 20
>   minutes.
>
>   The talk sounds kind of interesting and I'm sure it can get accepted by plenty
>   of conferences.

### What I like about the rejection email

##### My talk would be too long
I missed this completely, 20 minutes is a good speech length, not enough time 
to go over what I said I would).

#### My talk wouldn't _wow_ people 
True enough, reading back over it. I should have submitted something like 
'A Lambda, a Proc, and a Block walk into a bar'... and talk about how their 
similarities and differences).

#### My speaking qualifications are there
I'm sending enough information in my submissions to convey I'm decent on stage)

### Suggestions for Conference Organizers

Feedback like this would be very very awesome to send out to people who asked 
to speak at your conferences. Brutal honesty is best: otherwise the speakers 
won't know what to change to get better.
