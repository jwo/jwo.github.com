Oh hai there! This is me:
-------------

![JWo](/images/jesse_wolgamott.jpg)

I'm a ruby developer. 

Once upon a time I was a C# developer, and before that I hacked on CGI and PHP. Probably should have skipped the 7 years in C# land.

And before that I setup a BBS (dialup modem to some other dude's computer) in middle school (1990 ish?).

I founded [Comal Productions](http://comalproductions.com), and spent two years building enough clients to quit our fulltime jobs and focus on Comal. I create web apps, websites, mobile apps, and I help developers with Training.

I spend an awful lot of time on Stack Overflow ([I'm kind of a big deal](http://stackoverflow.com/users/363881/jesse-wolgamott)).

I speak at the Houston Ruby Group, and Lone Star Ruby Conference for the last two years.
