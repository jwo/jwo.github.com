### Bio
<img src="/images/jesse_wolgamott.jpg" style="width: 200px; float: left; padding-right: 3rem"/>
JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y’all. (born in
Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan — all before he
was 6), and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After
Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school
reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed
Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and Javascripts. Jesse
has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an
open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since
2012, authored a book on AngularJS+Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007.
Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined
that Tacos rule and salads drool.
