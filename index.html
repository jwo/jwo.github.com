		<p>Teaching Ruby has been awesome. It’s been so awesome that I want more. I want to 
meet the students face to face, and help change their lives for the better.  To
make that happen, I’m going to teach Rails at Houston’s first open-source stack code school.
The Iron Yard Houston. Classes start June 2nd.</p>

<p>In March, I flew to Greenville, South Carolina, to experience a course first
hand. The cohorts were 8 weeks into their JavaScript course, and amazed me with 
their abilities. This was the real deal (discussing how to make
Backbone models more maintainable). The Iron Yard came to Houston, and asked me
to teach the Rails Engineering course. I kept looking for a reason to say no

		<p>Day 5: crash. Day 6: crash. Each day, we were receiving notifications from
Rackspace that the server had exceeded its memory allocation and was thrashing
too hard; it rebooted our server for us.</p>

<p>My initial reaction: Increase the memories!</p>

<p>I looked deeper into the problem, and along with some colleagues, discovered
that at midnight our server was kicking off 9 different processes at the same 
time. 9x Rails is just about 8x too many.</p>

<p>We’ve all been there – you have code that needs to be run, and it’s taking forever. You wish there was a way to speed things along, but you can’t tweak the algorithm. You read about multi-threading but hear tales of dragons, pirates, and warnings of people who have ventured before you never to return.</p>

<p>But fear not! <a href="http://celluloid.io">Celluloid</a> exists, and is awesome. It’s an actor based implementation, but all you <em>need</em> to know is that it’s awesome. You can process an array of things in parallel, and continue when it’s complete.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/RellyAB/status/298467323419967489">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are a guy and you want to help fight the good fight, tell people why you want diversity and not dickery, from your point of view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comes after:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ashe Dryden <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/we-deserve-better-than-this">was treated horribly</a>  </li>
  <li>Sarah Parmenter (whom I’ve never spoken to) <a href="http://www.sazzy.co.uk/2013/02/speaking-up/">was treated horribly</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And this is in the last week. </p>

<p>So. Why do I want diversity (and not dickery) in our field? a) it makes economic sense, b) we need to create better software and more of the same probably isn’t going to help, and c) it’s the human thing to do.</p>

		<p>I built Ruby off Rails because ruby is awesome, and there are too many developers who don’t realize it. And the more I trained people, the more I found that: <em>Developers who learn ruby first learn Rails Best</em>.
###Announcing: <a href="http://rubyoffrails.com">Ruby Off Rails</a></p>

<p>That means, they pick up on concepts about instance variables, validations, how to create non-ActiveRecord classes, and most importantly: testing.</p>
